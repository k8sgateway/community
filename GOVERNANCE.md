# K8sGateway governance

This document details the governance model for the K8sGateway Project.

## Roles and membership


Review the following files:

- [`ROLES.md`](https://github.com/k8sgateway/community/blob/main/ROLES.md) for the different roles that you can have.
- [`MAINTAINERS.md`](https://github.com/k8sgateway/community/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md) for the project maintainers, including their organizational affiliation.


## Conflict resolution and voting

We anticipate resolving most issues through consensus in the community. For the rare occasion when consensus is unclear, a public vote will be held. The following rules govern our voting process:

- A simple majority decides the vote outcome.
- A vote is cast when a project maintainer emotes thumbs-up or thumbs-down (üëç or üëé) on the GitHub PR in dispute.
- No single company should cast more than six votes. It is the responsibility of each company to determine which affiliated maintainers will vote.
- Voting must be open for at least one week or until everyone entitled to vote has voted.
- The results will be tallied and commented in a PR approval message or in a closing comment.

## Governance policies
Below is a list of documents which define the governance policies for the project:

- [Code of Conduct](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)

## Changes to governance

All changes to our governance model require a vote by the maintainers. The proposed change will be submitted as a PR against the K8sGateway community repository. Voting will proceed according to the rules established for simple conflict resolution, with the sole exception being the threshold for acceptance.

- Any change requires a 2/3 super majority to be accepted.

## Vendor-neutrality

K8sGateway is committed to [vendor-neutrality](https://contribute.cncf.io/maintainers/community/vendor-neutrality/). Our governance process has been designed to limit the influence of individual companies in furtherance of this goal.

<!---
TODO: Enumerate what, precisely, constitutes a change in governance. I think it's clear editing this file, in any significant way, would count. Adjusting at least certain things wrt to the maintainer lifecycle also would likely constitute a governance change because this would directly impact who is, and is not, able to vote as well as who may be eligable or not in the future.
