# K8sGateway Governance

This document details the governance model for the K8sGateway Project.

## Roles and Membership

Roles are described in our [Community Roles](https://github.com/k8sgateway/community/blob/main/ROLES.md) document.
The list of current maintainers their organizational affiliations are kept in our [MAINTAINERS](https://github.com/k8sgateway/community/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md) file.


## Conflict Resolution and Voting

We anticipate that most issues will be resolved by reaching consensus in our community. For the rare occasion when consensus is unclear, a public vote will be held. The following rules govern our voting process:

- A simple majority decides the vote outcome.
- A vote is cast when a project maintainer emotes üëç or üëé on the GitHub PR in dispute.
- No single company should cast more than 6 votes. It is the responsibility of each company to determine which affiliated maintainers will vote.
- Voting must be open for at least 1 week or until everyone entitled to vote has voted.
- The results will be tallied and commented in a PR approval message or in a closing comment.

## Changes to Governance

All changes to our governance model require a vote by the maintainers. The proposed change will be submitted as a PR against the K8sGateway community repository. Voting will proceed according to the rules established for simple conflict resolution, with the sole exception being the threshold for acceptance.

- Any change requires a 2/3 super majority to be accepted.
