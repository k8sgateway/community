# K8sGateway Governance

This document details the governance model for the K8sGateway Project.

## Roles and Membership


Review the following files:
* [`ROLES.md`](https://github.com/k8sgateway/community/blob/main/ROLES.md) for the different roles that you can have.
* [`MAINTAINERS.md`](https://github.com/k8sgateway/community/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md) for the project maintainers, including their organizational affiliation.


## Conflict Resolution and Voting

We anticipate resolving most issues through consensus in the community. For the rare occasion when consensus is unclear, a public vote will be held. The following rules govern our voting process:

- A simple majority decides the vote outcome.
- A vote is cast when a project maintainer emotes thumbs-up or thumbs-down (üëç or üëé) on the GitHub PR in dispute.
- No single company should cast more than six votes. It is the responsibility of each company to determine which affiliated maintainers will vote.
- Voting must be open for at least one week or until everyone entitled to vote has voted.
- The results will be tallied and commented in a PR approval message or in a closing comment.

## Changes to Governance

All changes to our governance model require a vote by the maintainers. The proposed change will be submitted as a PR against the K8sGateway community repository. Voting will proceed according to the rules established for simple conflict resolution, with the sole exception being the threshold for acceptance.

- Any change requires a 2/3 super majority to be accepted.
