# K8sGateway community roles

This document describes the different individual roles community members can have, the requirements of each role, and the privileges that come with the role.

## Summary

The organization has two named roles: Reviewer and Maintainer. An individual may also have one or more Specialization Areas which denote their area(s) of expertise.

## Reviewer

Reviewer is the first step towards becoming a maintainer. Reviewers should be active in the community and have been actively contributing for 3 months. A reviewer will be granted the ability to manage GitHub Issues and Pull Requests in one or more project repositories based on their expertise and project contributions.

## Maintainer

Maintainers have made five significant contributions to the project in one or more areas. A maintainer should already be a reviewer in the respective area they seek to become a maintainer in.

## Specialization areas

- Controller
- Docs
- Proxy

## Maintainers emerita

If a maintainer has been inactive for more than 1 year, a member of the community may file a PR thanking the maintainer for their contributions and moving them to [Emeritus](https://glossary.cncf.io/contributor-ladder/#stepping-downemeritus-process) status. The maintainer being honored may approve the PR to accept or leave a comment with an explanation for their absence. The maintainer being honored should be given generous time to respond before merging the organization change.
